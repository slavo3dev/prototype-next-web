            <h2>NFTs Guarantee Ownership</h2>
            <p>
              NFT seller is also the owner of any intellectual property rights in the underlying asset.
              When someone buys an NFT from the creator, they obtain ownership in the sense that it becomes their property. After all, an NFT is a digital certificate of ownership representing the purchase of a digital asset, traceable on the blockchain. But the NFT holder does not have any other rights to the work.
